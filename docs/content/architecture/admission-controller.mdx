# Admission Controller

Admission Controller of the Kubernetes is one of the most interesting features
in the whole Kubernetes ecosystem! With that feature, you can intercept API
calls, and then read the call content before execution (useful for validation
of the request) and even change parts of the request.

On this page, we shortly walk through this feature, the most known
implementations, and practice of applying it on real workloads.

## Objects

This feature basically consists of three parts: `ValidationAdmission`,
`MutatingAdmission`, and `AdmissionPolicy` (available by default since 1.30).

Same as for other Kubernetes features, you use Kubernetes objects in API for
configuring Admission Controller. There are 2 old and well-known objects and
one pretty new:

* `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` is a global, non-namespaced resource in
Kubernetes that sets up a filter rule for API actions. When this rule is
triggered, it sends all relevant information about the action to the specified
endpoint. The Kubernetes API then expects the admission webhook server to
check if the action is valid and return a 200 status for success or a non-200
code if there are any issues (with an optional error message).

* The `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` is a global resource similar to
`ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` object but offers additional functionality
by allowing action modifications. While validating webhooks only respond with
status codes and may include optional error or notification message, mutating
webhooks can also respond with a JSON body containing patches that modify the
original manifest. This is where you can inject a sidecar container for your
workload (like Istio does), secrets (e.g. with HashiCorp Vault), security
policies, and whatever you want in the manifest.

* `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` is also a global object, but in difference with
other objects, it doesn't require additional components or endpoints. It is
and integrated admission controller, which can validate objects by policies
defined on pretty flexible DSL language, known as CEL. It basically has
conditions and constraints for detecting which actions should be validated
(`matchConditions` and `matchConstraints` fields), and the list of CEL
policies (field `validations`). This integrated controller comes to get rid
of mess around validation policies, because earlier it had multiple vendors
(like Kyverno, Open Policy Agent, etc).

## How It Works

You can configure Kubernetes API doing additional webhooks for every create,
update, and delete action in the cluster. For example, when you configure
the webhook for every create action for Pod component with specific label,
Kubernetes API will perform the webhook to the configured endpoint BEFORE
running the action. The webhook contains the content related to the object
(like current state, changes in there, who's performing the call, etc), thus
the endpoint can read this and respond. Depending on the response content
(return code and body) and the webhook configuration, Kubernetes API decides
what to do next: cancel call with an exception, continue with notice,
silently run the action, or apply changes from the response (which might
differ from original changes).

This pattern allows implementing the flexible manifest validation (for
example, by some defined security policies), sidecar injection, and just an
advanced audit of actions in cluster.

You should understand a few important things about Admission Controller:

* It cannot work with read requests (get, list, and watch verbs). Don't even
think about Kubernetes-native rootkit, it doesn't work here :)
* The controller can be ignored or bypassed if it doesn't work (configurable).
Thus, it's pretty redundant feature.
* The feature intercepts ALL calls by the specified filter (kind, namespace,
label, etc). Including the calls from other internal controllers. If your
`StatefulSet` creates `PersistentVolumeClaim` and you have configured to
intercept that action, the Admission Controller will also perform webhook for
that. Then you will see in the webhook that it's an action of the internal
controller (usually it's the `ServiceAccount` of `kuber-controller-manager` or
one of its sub-`ServiceAccount`-s).
* The Admission Controller can communicate with external endpoints as well as
with the internal ones. It means that it's the easiest way to steal `Secret`s
from the Kubernetes, pretty silently. Thus, always control what your admission
controllers do.
* There are a lot of attack vectors for Admission Controller. Follow security
considerations for running admission services.
* This feature is so useful, that it's hardly possible to run Kubernetes
without it.
* `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` doesn't require additional services to be
installed, it's already integrated in Kubernetes API server (if not disabled
by feature gate).
* All admission webhooks require secure TLS configuration. You should specify
CA certificate for verification of the admission controller endpoint. This is
an important security measure.

## Use Cases

Let's learn by example, because there are a plenty of them, starting from CNI
and CSI, ending with custom security policies handlers and backup operators.

Please keep in mind that author doesn't take precedence to any of mentioned
vendors and/or solutions. Here we review how they work, just to find out why
and for what reason they use admission controller.

### Istio

The main goal of [Istio](https://istio.io/) is expanding the network protocols
support and flexibility for workloads intercommunication. For example, you can
enable mutual TLS between pods absolutely transparently for both server and
client sides of the application.

The main way how Istio enable this functionality, is by their admission
controller which injects sidecar containers which can manage network rules for
intercepting incoming and/or outgoing traffic, can start Envoy server (reverse
proxy) if necessary, apply content modification (e.g. encapsulate into TLS),
etc.

You can witness this in action after installing Istio and then creating a pod
with single container (and corresponding labels of course, to activate Istio).
You set in manifest only one container, but at least 2 appears in the cluster.

### Nginx Ingress Controller

Everyone who worked with Kubernetes knows what is [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx),
but not too many people know that it actually use validating admission webhook
under the hood.

This Ingress Controller has a lot of configuration options, but still not that
powerful and flexible as Nginx configuration. After all, Nginx configuration
is like a specialized language. To reach this gap, the maintainers proposed
to use snippets in annotations, which controller embeds into its
configuration. Since engineers can freely shoot their feet (multiple times, in
multiple ways) with that snippet, including silently leave a security flaw in
the configuration, maintainers decided to enable some validation here, with
the integrated admission controller.

### Vault Secrets Injector

[HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) is a well-know secrets
storage with a plenty of features. It works pretty fine in Kubernetes cluster,
and also comes with [the secret injector](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/deploy/kubernetes/injector)
admission controller.

Since Kubernetes `Secret`s aren't secrets actually (because just only
base64-encoded binary data), one day enterprise starts thinking about more
secure approach to store secrets for Kubernetes-located workloads. One of the
options, it enabling secure secrets storage (Vault for this example) and
automate secrets provisioning into pods. With the secrets injector, you can
provision secrets without disclosing it on the Kubernetes API level. Only the
configured Pod is able to read/use the provisioned secret. Of course, it uses
mutating admission webhook: it adds init and/or sidecar pod which takes the
requested secrets from Vault, then prepares the environment for the
application, and when the application has been started then watches for
changes in secrets.

### Cert Manager

[Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is a well-known application which
allows managing TLS certificates by Kubernetes objects. The most popular case
is issuing LetsEncrypt TLS certificate, which is free and valid in almost all
browsers.

Unexpectedly, this application uses a mutating admission webhook for
monitoring newly created certificate requests and processing them directly
during the API call.

### Stash Operator

[Stash Operator](https://github.com/stashed/stash) is a complex application
which brings backup functionality for the Kubernetes workloads. It leverages
sidecar injection (mutating admission webhook) technique. The sidecar
containers just wait for backup and restore actions from the main controller
(operator) and perform corresponding actions, including pushing/pulling
files to/from backup storage, replacing them at place, notifying the
application, restarting it if necessary, etc.

### Kyverno and Open Policy Agent

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) and [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
are the same-class same-goal extensions of Kubernetes API. They work on top
of the Kubernetes Admission Controller and just implement policy-based
restrictions for the management of Kubernetes objects.

You should understand the difference with RBAC. Kubernetes RBAC works on the
level of overall request parameters, such as kind, verb (action), who
requested, and is he allowed to request that. These controllers work deeply
and can also control particular fields in every manifest, with the policies
definitions.

The story of these components starts many years ago, before Kubernetes showed
their own Admission Policies (generally available since 1.30).

## Validating Admission Policies

As mentioned above, this is the pretty new feature which must replace all 
existing implementations of policy engines for Kubernetes manifests. At least,
it has a good chance to replace existing solutions in favor to the unified
one.

In difference with the validation and mutation webhooks, this type of
admission controller objects doesn't require additional services. This is
already available feature right within Kubernetes API. Just start declaring
your `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` objects.

The typical policy consists of match rules (detection rules which answer the
question "should this policy validate this object/manifest") and validation
rules itself.

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: coredns.example.tld
spec:
  failurePolicy: Fail # or Ignore
  ###
  ### Common match rules for the 
  ###
  matchConstraints:
    matchPolicy: Equivalent # or Exact
    ###
    ### Namespace selector
    ###
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
    ###
    ### Label selector
    ###
    objectSelector:
      matchLabels:
        k8s-app: kube-dns
    ###
    ### Kind and verb selectors
    ###
    resourceRules:
      - apiGroups:   [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations:  ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
        resources:   ["pods"]
    ###
    ### Anti-selectors (excluders)
    ###
    excludeResourceRules: []
  ###
  ### More flexible match rules, with all flexibility of CEL
  ### language. Since CEL expressions have some little CPU consumption,
  ### it's recommended to prefer the constraints.
  ###
  matchConditions:
    - name: "Just a useless check with valid CEL expression"
      expression: 'object.apiVersion == "v1"'
  ###
  ### Validation rules in CEL language. 
  ###
  validations:
    - expression: 'object.spec.template.spec.containers.all(x, x.image.startsWith(variables.coredns_image + ":"))'
      message: "There is only one DNS with superpowers, and it's CoreDNS"  # simple message
      # messageExpression: >-                                              # complex message
      #   "Expected \"" + variables.coredns_image + "\" image, but "
      #   + object.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image + " provided"
      reason: Invalid
  ###
  ### You can create variables, with CEL expression. Here let's
  ### just specify a constant variable.
  ###
  variables:
    - name: coredns_image
      expression: '"registry.k8s.io/coredns/coredns"'
```

You can play with CEL language online, with this portal: https://playcel.undistro.io/

You also should definitely review [the official guideline](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/).
It will be a way simpler to understand it after this page.

## Mutating Admission Policy

`MutatingAdmissionPolicy` is not yet generally available, it's in alpha since
v1.32. This manifest advances the `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` with mutations.
You can specify patch right in the manifest. However, this object has a very
limited usage, only for simple cases, for example for enforcing drop of all
capabilities if no one specified (kinda change of the default capabilities).
For more complex cases, it's more preferable to write your own admission
controller engine, it's not that difficult.

## Quick Summary

Admission Controller is one of the features of Kubernetes, that everyone use or
used, but not too many know how it really work. Welcome to the family, now you
know what it is, how it work, how to use it, and the most useful is how to fix
that in case of issues.
