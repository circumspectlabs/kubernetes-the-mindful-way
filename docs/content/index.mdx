# Introduction

This is an e-book which follows the idea of [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) tutorial.
Samewise as the original guideline, this e-book is aimed to improve the awareness
of the essentials and internals of this complex technology.

Unfortunately, the original topic doesn't cover many critical details and isn't
targeted to directly the real production use cases for on-premise deployments.
You still cannot run your own managed service without significant rework of artifacts
produced by well-know utilities. Moreover, these improvements may damage reliability
and/or security of the entire system, if you do it without understanding.

The main goal of this e-book is not only provide you step-by-step guide how to
bootstrap and configure your own Kubernetes cluster, but also how to mindfully
make the reasonful architectural decisions.

This e-book is a deeper version of the well-known and lovely tutorial. It reveals the
internals of running the reliable and secure self-hosted Kubernetes clusters. It also
includes the minimal set of guidelines for operation, such as security hardening,
upgrading, patching, maintenance practices, and hints and tips for security
engineers, platform engineers, and developers.

The best reading experience is with the online version. You are in the right place:

## Target Audience

This is a must-read for all software and platform architects, and people who
just want to get the promotion. Or course, it's also very useful for developers,
devops engineers, reliability engineers, security engineers, even cloud
practitioners (especially when you try to recover a broken managed Kubernetes).

## Difference with The Hard Way

Long story short, it's a kind of "well-architected framework" for on-premise
Kubernetes clusters. It's even very helpful for engineering teams who develop
their own managed services!

[The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) reveals
how to bootstrap the simplest self-hosted Kubernetes cluster, without redundancy and
practically insecure. It's more like a set of advanced labs for students, it's too
far from the real production use cases.

On the other side, "The Mindful Way" uncovers deeper details and thin configuration
of the production self-hosted clusters. Practically, companies adopt Kubernetes because
it is a simpler way to provide reliability and continuous services, than with the
old-school ways. Thus, the production-ready solution should always have some reliability
and security.

This set of articles and code ("learn by example") explain the theory and practice of
running self-hosted Kubernetes clusters, e.g. goes way deeper into configuration to
provide the necessary level of service, whatever business needs. It also has the
well-structured Ansible code which explains things better than just a spoken/written
word.

The best part: you can use the code or some parts of it for the real self-hosted cluster
deployments or workloads configurations, with minimal changes.

As mentioned above, [The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
doesn't cover high-availability, maintenance procedures, security, security and
reliability threat models, best practices, etc. And this book does! It's also useful
as an advancement of [Kubernetes CIS benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes).

## Author's Motivation

The main purpose of this e-book is making the software engineers around the earth
(hopefully, one day not only earth) more aware how to apply Kubernetes. Most of
all engineers use only 10% of this powerful technology. Moreover, for some cases,
inappropriate configuration of some component of the whole system might be harmful
for the business. This book is designed to prevent such issues. And, of course,
to simplify software engineer's job and reduce amount of work for architects and
technical teams' managers.

Any contribution is very welcome! Feel free to leave a pull request or a GitHub
issue, but please always remember about the following simple rules:

* This book is versioned! Every new release might be patch, minor, or major
release, similarly to a software. It's normal when you don't see your merged
changes in the online book, please have some patience
* For the code, snippets, and scripts, please don't forget to check the linters
and autotests (if any for the context of change). This repository also has some
pipeline automation
* For the articles, please keep the similar to other pages structure
* English version is multinational one. To make it easier for everyone around
the world, please try to keep the language about B1 academic level
* Other languages are free from this recommendation. And of course, any
localization is very welcome!

**Enjoy reading :)** And feel free to leave feedback, I'll appreciate!
