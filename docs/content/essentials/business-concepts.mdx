# Business Concepts

This article mostly explains business and management side of the most known
development practices, in the context of Kubernetes systems. This might be useful
for engineers of all kinds, and for non-technical people who still have to be
close to development and technical stuff.

## DevOps

**DevOps** is a well-known shorthand of Development and Operations, and it's a set
of practices. Usually we use is as a specific job title for the software engineers
who are responsible for that set of practices. The practices include everything
what can improve the velocity of development teams.

From the business side, it's a way to make the development process more effective,
speed up and make more reliable delivery to production, simplify requirements to
the developers (to lower the job description requirements, thus simplify hiring),
reduce amount of human errors during development, etc. The benefits are usually
worth only for compliance-, security-, and reliability- heavy projects, or starting
from middle+ sized development teams.

For the Kubernetes environment, Kubernetes is a useful part of technical stack which
allows implementing smooth processes of releasing and maintaining software (business
logic) with respect to SLA (identified in the contracts level of reliability,
security, etc). Useful features: rolling updates, autoscaling, enhanced resource
management, automated networking and service discovery, etc.

## Platform Engineering

**Platform Engineering** is a process of maintaining and developing the **Internal
Development Platform**. 

**Internal Development Platform** is a set of services, scripts, tools, templates, and
standards for streamlining the process of software development, including the
development itself, source code management, continuous integration, software delivery,
software maintenance, development contracts enforcement, etc.

<Callout type="warning">
**Internal Development Platform** might be shorten to IDP, and IdP is an
**Identity Provider** (a kind of security services which manages access of someone
to something - usually a part of an **Internal Development Platform**). Don't mistake
here, there are IDP and IdP.

Platform Engineers are usually just software engineers who are responsible for the
internal software and services (see the definition above). You can segregate a
specific development team for that set of responsibilities, and then they can
improve the key metrics of other development teams.

It is not the same as just enforcement of the existing development team. The
development process strongly relies upon communication between members, thus
every next +1 member in a team requires the whole team communicate more. From
some amount of members, it makes every next team enforcement less effective.
However, if you separate some developers with this specific set of responsibilities
to another team, there will be no such effect.

From the business side, it's the next level or process efficiency. When your
business grows, and it becomes affordable, you can enable this practice to make
the development process even more effective (after DevOps practices).

In almost any internal development platform, Kubernetes plays the core role. It's
already a corporate standard, de facto and de jure. Useful features: flexible RBAC,
admission controllers, extensible functionality (with operators), etc.

## DevSecOps

**DevSecOps** is another level of DevOps. Correspondingly, with Development and
Operations, it includes Security. As same as for DevOps engineers, we name
some specific software engineers as "DevSecOps" when they are responsible for
security measures according to the information security policy and compliance
programs. DevOps and DevSecOps usually work together, because security is complex
and takes a lot of efforts, and someone still has to take care about reliability
and development processes automation.

From some point of business growth, you must enable some budget for security and
risks management. These guys, at least, can decrease these risks to the acceptable
level. For some specific cases, like a cybersecurity product, it can even improve
the product attractiveness for customers.

Kubernetes is a very security-friendly technology which allows implementing from
basic to zero-trust level of security for almost any business case. Useful
features: flexible container security, network policies, admission controllers
(e.g. Gatekeeper, Kyverno), secrets managers (usually additinal components), etc.

## Quick Summary

Another and last part of theory is behind. If you are an engineer, now you can
prove your technical decision/opinion with a straight and clear business
explanation. For business persons, this topic just reduces the fog around some
engineering terms and practices.
