# Finite State Machines

The article explains one of the main patterns of Kubernetes. It's a must-read
for all junior-level software and security engineers.

---

**Finite State Machines** is the system pattern, which has a set of algorithms
of transforming objects, their statuses, and attributes. Every state machine
can transform (change) object by interface (available attributes) between some
exact states.

## Machine Example

It's simple to explain by example: there is a finite state machine for changing
pod status from "scheduling" to "pending".

This machine listens for just created pods in the control plane without node
assigned, it is a very initial status of pod. In other words, it waits for all
Pod objects (attribute ".kind" is "Pod") with a specific status (attribute
".status.phase" is "Pending" or undefined, and the ".spec.nodeName" is undefined).
This set of parameters the machine is looking for is the "interface" of the
machine.

As soon as the machine found a new object, it performs the necessary actions
(identifies the best fit node for this new pod, communicates with pod scheduler
and kubelet) and updates the object state (announces the new status, modifies
".spec.nodeName" and ".status.hostIP" fields, etc.). After that, this object might
fit to another machine's interface (e.g. kubelet's CNI handler).

## Chains and Loops

Kubernetes is a complex system with thousands of state machines, chained to
each other and sometimes even cycled. For example, when you create a pod,
it passes at least through the state machines which perform transition of the
object between Pending → Running → Succeeded states.

Practically, almost all machines are non-atomic. It means that they might have
different output depending on the object, configuration, etc. For example, a
pod with "Running" state might come to "Succeeded" or "Failed" state depending
on the behavior of the application in the pod.

More complex case: cycled state machines. For example, when you run some pod,
it might end up with "Failed" state. Then, it activates the new state machine
which waits some time and restarts this pod. This may repeat until the
successful execution. The only change between iterations is a delay before
start (it increases every iteration).

<Callout type="warning">
Cycled state machines are dangerous, same as the infinite loops in
programming. Ensure your state machines can exit from this loop. It also might
be useful to enable integration tests for this case, if you develop some
operator.

## Native and External

Native state machines are the embedded logic of Kubernetes. And it is
expandable and modifiable. For example, you can write your own scheduler for
Kubernetes, or modify its logic as you want. By the way, it's not recommended
because might significantly increase the complexity of the whole system.

Another case: Kubernetes Operators. This is the external state machines you
can bring to your cluster. For example, a very useful operator-like solution:
cert-manager. It allows issuing SSL certificates right in the Kubernetes
environment, and it's easy to install.

## Risks of Operators

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There is a term [Cognitive Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_complexity).
Kubernetes is complex, and every new operator makes it even more complex.
Every new state machine makes your systems more complex for troubleshooting
and the next maintenance.

The risks of using Kubernetes operators is usually directly addressed to
reliability and security. For example, when you work with "Stash" operator
which only enables ability to back up your workloads, then you must deploy
extra pods with direct access to the Kubernetes API, including "pod/exec"
action. In case of leak of its service account token, the whole cluster
might be compromised. In addition, Stash operator enables a sidecar
container, thus enables the risks of unstable work (i.e. in case of memory
leak in this sidecar pod, or even bug in the logic of dump of a database or
a filesystem).

Every operator increases the costs of maintenance of the whole system. If you
want to adopt the operator, ensure it saves more resources (you don't need
to implement your own backup system nor maintain it too much) than consumes
(it requires some efforts from maintainers).

## Quick Summary

After you read this topic, you should understand the essential part of the
[Automata Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). Now
it should be simple to systematize your knowledge about behavior of
Kubernetes objects.
