# Smart Objects Storage

This article explains another pattern applied in Kubernetes. Same as for
[Finite State Machines](/essentials/finite-state-machines), this article
will be helpful for every engineer who works with Kubernetes.

---

When you learn something, it's always useful to compare
solution/product/system/anything with something. After a few iterations, you
can identify similar patterns in different solutions.

In that case, Kubernetes seems quite remarkable and even unique from some points.
It might be an invention, but I want to introduce the new pattern and name it
**"Smart Objects Storage"**. The main attributes of this system pattern are the
following:

* It stores objects which might be represented in some well-structured format.
For Kubernetes, every manifest (like for Pod, Deployment, Node, NetworkPolicy,
etc.) is a presentation of an object.

* There are finite state machines which control the state and sometimes the
attributes of an object. Please read more about finite state machines in [another topic](/essentials/finite-state-machines).
Every machine can work with one or more objects and perform actions. The main
purpose of these machines is syncing the state of the objects (i.e. pod status)
with the actions (i.e. deploying a pod, or horizontal scaling of a deployment).

By the way, the closer research of the pattern reveals that it is absolutely
applicable to other technologies, including but not limiting to OpenStack,
public clouds (such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.), and other
products.

## Objects and Machines

Every native object has some schema (the "shape" of object), and every state machine
is described in code, within components of Kubernetes.

Let's learn by example: look at these object from a new point of view. Pod and Node
are the most complex objects, and the simplest one is, unexpectedly, Deployment.

### Pods

Pods have a multi-stage status, with the chain of states at least like Pending
→ Running → Succeeded. Every transition between states has its own state
machine, and usually more than one! For example, the state "Pending" has its own
chain of states, at least Pulling → CRI (creating the containers) → CNI
(configuring networking, assigning IP, firewall rules, etc.). See
[Pod Lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)
topic for details.

But these stages only explain the lifecycle of the pod. There are also the state
machines for:

* **Liveness, readyness, statup probes.** They start watching the pod. In case of
change of probes' response, they correspondingly change the object and mark it as
"NotReady". This transition usually activates another state machine which excludes
this pod from the endpoints of the service. More details about this set of state
machines is available in [Configure Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
topic.

* **Ephemeral containers.** The relevant state machine expects the new ephemeral
container for this pod (because it's one of mutable fields of the manifest), and
can activate the corresponding changes in CRI (create container, start some
payload in there, etc.). More details are in the [Ephemeral Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/)
topic.

* **Pod Resize.** This automation is enabled by default only since `v1.33`, for
previous versions you need to enable `kube:InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true`
feature gate. It allows changing requests and limits of a pod directly without
restart. This state machine watches the Pod manifest's option `.spec.containers[*].resources`
and performs corresponding API calls to CRI. More details are in the
[In Place Pod Resize](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/12/in-place-pod-resize-alpha/)
topic. Some state machines might be disabled by default.

* Many other state machines. It's hardly possible to mention every feature
in single topic.

Most of all Pod state machines (their source code) are located in `controler-manager`
and `kubelet` components.

### Node

Similarly to Pod kind, the Node has lifecycle and many other controllers.
Let's try to enumerate some of them (not a full list):

* **Node registration.** The first attempt to communicate with the control
plane must register the new Node. Normally, the `kubelet` must perform it
automatically. De facto, the `kubelet` must have enough permissions for
this operation, and it's tricky in terms of security of it. In addition,
you usually cannot directly create a Node, because it's a system object
with very custom state machines.

* **Node networking.** This is a complex set of the state machines which is
responsible for configuring the container networking, IP addresses, firewall
rules, NAT and mangling rules, etc.

* **Node conditions.** When your node runs out of memory or capacity of
some resource, it goes into the "SomethingPressure" mode. This state machine
can identify that condition on the node, and then enable the taint for the
corresponding node (i.e. "NoSchedule" taint to stop scheduling the new
workloads on this node).

* **Images storage.** This set of state machines controls the available
container images and cleanups them if necessary. It also exposes a limited
set of available images in the Node objects (see `.status` of the Node).

* Other state machines.

Most of all relevant state machines are located in `kubelet` and `kube-proxy`
components, and partially in CRI and CNI.

### Deployment

As defined above, it's one of the simplest state machines. The only
responsibility of this object is creating the new ReplicaSet (child object
with strong dependency) correspondingly to the applied changes, and then
one-by-one change the parameter `.spec.replicas` for the new and the old
ReplicaSet objects. That's it. Deployment object includes the full
description of the ReplicaSet, and ReplicaSet includes the full description
of the Pod, but Deployment is only responsible for creating the new version
of ReplicaSet and migration between them.

These state machines are in `controller-manager` component.

## Custom Resource Definitions

These objects (Kubernetes kind "CustomResourceDefinition") just enable the
smart objects storage managing non-native objects. You create CRD and then
cat put the objects of the new type (the new Kubernetes kind) into the place
available for the whole cluster. But these objects do nothing yet, because
they don't have any state machine. The Kubernetes operators enable the
intended functionality for the Kubernetes cluster, usually with CRDs.

For example, there is a well-known operator [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/).
This operator enables the ability to manage TLS/SSL certificates, in
different ways. The Helm chart of this solution deploys [CRDs](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/tree/v1.16.2/deploy/crds)
and the [controllers](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/tree/v1.16.2/deploy/charts/cert-manager)
with the corresponding state machines.

This component has no native state machine, but the logic of how to work with
CRDs is in `kubeapi` component.

### Ingress

This is a strange object, because it NATIVELY doesn't have any state machine,
but it is enabled by default for any cluster. There is a native Kubernetes
kind, but it has no any native logic!

The Kubernetes developers team decided to drop the implementation of the L7
routing within the cluster, and provide the cluster's administrators to pick
the best fit controller. All Ingress Controllers do the same job with the
Ingress objects, and every controller does it in its own way.

Some Ingress Controllers don't use the Ingress object and prefer to create
CRDs with different jsonschema (like [Traefik IngressRoute](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-crd/) objects).

There are a plenty of Kubernetes Ingress Controllers, the list of available
ones is here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/

## Quick Summary

Smart Objects Storage is an "invented" pattern, but it explains almost
everything what happen in Kubernetes. This is a kind of "foundational" or
"framing" knowledge which helps to connect all of your experience and
knowledge about Kubernetes.
